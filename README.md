# TASKS:

# 1   Train the classifiers using the first 1600 instances. Test the trained classifiers on the remaining instances.
# 2   Data Cleaning: Handle the missing feature values (e.g., remove missing features, use mean or median value or fill the most popular value).
# 3   Classification Part:
      Use three classifiers: 
      (1) Na√Øve Bayes 
      (2) ID3 Decision Trees 
      (3) Random Forest
# 4   Per class classification accuracy, and confusion matrix to compare the results.
# 5   Compare the accuracies of the classifiers when trained on first 500, 750, and 1250 instances and always reserving the last 200 instances for testing.
