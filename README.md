# TASKS

#    Train the classifiers using the first 1600 instances. Test the trained classifiers on the remaining instances.
#    Data Cleaning: Handle the missing feature values (e.g., remove missing features, use mean or median value or fill the most popular value).
#    Classification Part:
      Use three classifiers: 
      (1) Na√Øve Bayes 
      (2) ID3 Decision Trees 
      (3) Random Forest
#    Per class classification accuracy, and confusion matrix to compare the results.
#    Compare the accuracies of the classifiers when trained on first 500, 750, and 1250 instances and always reserving the last 200 instances for testing.
